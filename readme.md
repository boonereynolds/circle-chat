# Circle Chat 

## Intro 
For Project 4, I will be making creating a location-based chat room app that utilizes MEAN stack techonolgies. Users will be able to create a chat room within a certain radius of their location, other users in that "circle" will be added to the chat room and they will be able to communicate with each other. I see this app being used in a variety of setting like a college campus, large and small event, and possibly in disaster-like situations.

[Frontend](https://github.com/boonereynolds/circlechat-frontend)

## Approach
This app will be built using MEAN stack to handle the front-end and back-end and will utilize Socket.io for the chat function. I will first get the models working properly, then implement the chat system, then implement the location-based system. 

## Technologies Used:
This project will use the following technologies:

* MEAN stack
* HTML
* CSS/Bootstrap 
* Socket.io
* Geolocation

## Installation Instructions
* Clone the back end repo
* Open the directory and run npm install
* Run nodemon & navigate to localhost:3000
* Clone the front end repo
* Open the directory and run server in the terminal
* Navigate to localhost:8000

## Known Problems
* Sign in does not work
* Front end controllers are broken :(
* Aka nothing works on the front end yet
